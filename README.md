# Optimization of the paths of delivery vans with capacities and non-linear optimization of a strategy game
This project is divided in to parts. The objective of the first part is to compute the paths of delivery vans in order to minimize the total distance covered by the vans, taking into account that each client has been visited onces. The second part defines a strategy videogame where the objective function is non-linear. This project is implemented using python, pyomo and gurobi to solve the problem.
